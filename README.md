 (Plotting Direction Fields!)

## Lab 2: Using Maple to solve Newton’s Law of Cooling (Week 5): ##

Because of timing, I used a problem from Practice Exam 1 to create a lab session. Thus, the lab has a dual purpose: to learn the first-order differential equation to model cooling/heating of a material subject to the ambient temperature, e.g., a hot cup of coffee cooling to drinkable temperature.

* **Problem 4 of the Practice Exam:** <br>
