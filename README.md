Repository includes computational labs in Maple and Matlab:


## Maple Lab 1: Getting Started with Maple (Week 3):

Here are 2 worksheets for getting started: 
* Download: <br> 
Maple_Gettingstarted_blank.mw (Getting Started!)
* Download: <br>
DFields_Logistic_And_blank_working.mw (Plotting Direction Fields!) 

## Maple Lab 2: Using Maple to solve Newtonâ€™s Law of Cooling (Week 5): ## 

Because of timing, I used a problem from Practice Exam 1 to create a lab session. Thus, the lab has a dual purpose: to learn the first-order differential equation to model cooling/heating of a material subject to the ambient temperature, e.g., a hot cup of coffee cooling to drinkable temperature.

* Problem 4 of the Practice Exam: <br>
